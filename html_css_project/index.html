          <h2>Welcome to Hair Day!</h2>
          <p>
            Hair Day is a boutique hair salon that specializes in cut, color and
            styling. Hair Day also offers makeup and nail services, prides
            itself on its warm and relaxing atmosphere and is best known for
            edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts. The salon can only accommodate a
            small number of coloring appointments each week, so clients need to
            book far in advance. To keep clients inspired between appointments,
            the employees share makeup and nail tutorials on the Hair Day
            website.

          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist
            and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring
            techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself" environment for
            her clients. Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented
            hairdresser, Garry. They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three
            colorists, one manicurist and one make-up artist.
